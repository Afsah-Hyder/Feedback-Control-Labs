# Feedback-Control-Labs

In this course, we developed mathematical models using input/output differential equations, transfer functions, state space representation, and closed-form solutions of linear time-invariant/nonlinear electrical, mechanical, and electromechanical systems. We analyzed the transient and steady-state performance and stability of linear time-invariant systems using Routhâ€™s criteria, root locus, and frequency domain analysis. Designing compensators/controllers to achieve desired closed-loop response for LTI systems using root locus and frequency-domain tools like Bode/ Nyquist plots.

For our lab component, we used Qube servo motor, and industry standard tools like Labview, MATLAB and Simulink.
